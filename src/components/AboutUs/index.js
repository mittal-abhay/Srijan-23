            History is just the present in retrospect. It reveals and sculpts
            the present. Srijan aims to help us connect with our culture and
            innovate it to bridge the gap between the colorful vintage times and
            the contemporary digital era. We can only truly know ourselves once
            we get in touch with our roots, and Srijan strives to do just that
            by letting us take a glimpse into our past. The numerous events and
            performances by stars that it offers help bridge the disconnect we
            feel between the vintage era and the contemporary one. Being in
            touch with our history is in vogue and Srijan would help us dive
            head first into our shared history and celebrate our present to look
            forward to a better future.

            Culture is considered to be an identification of a society or a
            nation as a whole. It inculcates a sense of togetherness through
            shared beliefs, values, traditions, and norms. Education or
            knowledge, when fostered in a cultured environment, leads to
            harmonious progress not only for an individual but also for the
            whole society, country, or entire globe. We take pride in India's
            unique culture, which serves as a metaphor for the nation's
            diversity. The majority of its social, economic, and other
            activities show evidence of culture and creativity.
            <br />
            <br />

            variety of activities that celebrate the different cultures of our
            country.The continual growth of our country is propelled by the
            ideas of the next generation
            <br />
            <br />

            talent and innovative and exuberant ideas that may help the social
            cause. It involves varieties of events through which the
            participants will hone their talents in skills like dancing,
            singing, poetry writing, arts, and so on before coming to a close
            with the much-anticipated gala star or cultural night.
