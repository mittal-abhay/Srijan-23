        <div className="container opaque">
          <br />
          Greetings! The past two years have been tough for everyone. As the
          saying goes, "Tough times don't last long but tough people do this
          tough time also challenged everyone to fight and bring out their best.
          To keep alive the thrill of innovation and the spirit of technological
          challenges, I am pleased to announce that the Indian Institute of
          Technology (SM) Dhanbad is organizing its flagship techno-management
          fest, "srijan 22", starting on 21st October 2022. The three-day fest
          organized by the institute's students aims to disseminate individual
          skills and mutual exchange of scientific knowledge through a series of
          technical and management events and seminars.
          <br />
          <br />
          To bridge the digital and physical worlds, this year's srijan is
          themed on the concept of AR/VR with the tagline Reality Beyond Vision"
          AR uses a real-world setting, while VR is entirely virtual This year,
          we plan to make the event grander by introducing new technical
          challenges and adding a new dimension to srijan
          <br />
          <br />
          The participation of the engineering and science departments of the
          institute and the students from other engineering institutes makes
          this fest an arena of innovation and creativity. This fest provides
          all young budding minds space to demonstrate their talent and grit
          <br />

          Further, talks delivered by eminent personalities and scientists
          during the fest also inspire and encourage all students to strive for
          greater success in life. I acknowledge all the efforts made by
          students, faculty members, and officials toward its successful
          execution. I also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all
          sponsors, advertisers, and media associated with this grand event
