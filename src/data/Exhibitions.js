      "srijan’19 in association with department of  electronics enginerring brings to you the 3D Printing exhibition.It is a process of manufacturing 3 dimentional objects designed on computer & directly commanded by the computer to the printer. By this technology and equipment it is possible to print 3d objects of any size and design, most accurately and at cheaper cost quickly. From 3D printing (making) of automobiles and aircrafts critical parts, architectural scale models to human body parts (prosthetics) to human tissues, everything thought can be made through this technology. This is the reason this technology is named as Technical Revolution, and is taking rapid prototyping and limited production as storm. This has further made innovations now easier and accessible.",
